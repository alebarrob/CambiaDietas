# CambiaDietas

This repository contains my first android application: CambiaDietas. It is an application that allows you to substitute a food in your diet for a different one and calculate the equivalent amount you should eat.

For example, if in today's diet you have to eat chicken but you feel like eating a pork chop, the app will tell you how much pork you should eat.

The application also includes some general nutrition advice on one of its screens, as well as the contact of a professional dietician in case you need more personalized attention.
